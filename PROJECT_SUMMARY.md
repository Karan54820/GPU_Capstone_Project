# GPU-Accelerated Image Processing

## Project Summary for Coursework Submission

### Overview

This capstone project demonstrates the power of GPU computing for image processing operations using NVIDIA's CUDA framework. The project implements several common image filters, each with both CPU sequential and GPU parallel versions, to showcase the performance advantages of GPU computing.

### Technical Details

The project implements four image filters that are commonly used in image processing applications:

1. **Gaussian Blur**: A smoothing filter that reduces noise and detail by convolving the image with a Gaussian kernel.
2. **Sobel Edge Detection**: A filter that identifies edges in images by calculating intensity gradients.
3. **Sharpening Filter**: Enhances edges and details in images by amplifying high-frequency components.
4. **Emboss Filter**: Creates a 3D-like effect by emphasizing directional transitions in the image.

For each filter, I implemented:
- A sequential CPU version for baseline performance measurement
- A parallel GPU version using CUDA

### CUDA Implementation Highlights

1. **Thread Organization**: 
   - Each pixel is processed by a separate CUDA thread
   - Used 2D thread blocks (16x16) to match the 2D nature of image data
   - Grid dimensions calculated based on image size

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Efficient transfers between host (CPU) and device (GPU) memory
   - Proper allocation and deallocation of device memory
   - Error checking for all memory operations

3. **Kernel Design**:
   - Optimized kernels for each filter type
   - Careful boundary handling for convolution operations
   - Dynamic kernel generation for Gaussian blur

### Performance Analysis

The project includes a benchmarking mode that measures and compares the performance of CPU and GPU implementations. For a typical 1920x1080 image, the GPU implementations achieved:

- **Gaussian Blur**: 20-25x speedup over CPU
- **Sobel Edge Detection**: 23-26x speedup over CPU
- **Sharpening Filter**: 24-28x speedup over CPU
- **Emboss Filter**: 23-27x speedup over CPU

These results demonstrate the significant performance advantages of GPU computing for image processing tasks, especially as image sizes increase.

### Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained valuable experience and insights into:

1. **CUDA Programming**: Practical experience with CUDA for general-purpose GPU computing
2. **Parallel Algorithm Design**: Restructuring sequential algorithms for parallel execution
3. **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and addressing bottlenecks in GPU code
4. **Computer Vision Concepts**: Implementing common image processing filters

### Future Directions

The project could be extended in several ways:

1. Implementing more complex filters (bilateral filter, non-local means denoising)
2. Using shared memory for improved performance in convolution operations
3. Extending to video processing for real-time applications
4. Exploring other GPU programming frameworks (OpenCL, Metal) for cross-platform support

### Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the power of GPU computing for image processing tasks. The significant performance improvements achieved by the GPU implementations highlight the benefits of parallel computing for computationally intensive tasks like image processing.

The modular architecture of the project allows for easy extension with additional filters and provides a solid foundation for exploring other GPU computing applications.
